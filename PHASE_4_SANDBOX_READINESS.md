```

### Step 2: Initial Deployment Validation (Day 1)
```
1. Run health check on sandbox portfolio
2. Verify all fixes are active
3. Test health check accuracy
4. Validate position size adaptation
5. Confirm consolidation logic
```

### Step 3: Extended Monitoring (Days 1-3)
```
Timeline: 48+ hours minimum

Metrics to Monitor:
├─ Portfolio Fragmentation Index

│  ├─ Detection accuracy
│  └─ Recovery rate
│
├─ Consolidation Activity
│  ├─ Frequency of consolidation
│  ├─ Positions consolidated per cycle
│  ├─ Success rate
│  └─ Average consolidation size
│
├─ Position Sizing Adaptation
│  ├─ Health-based multiplier changes
│  ├─ New position sizes vs baseline
│  ├─ Adaptation timing
│  └─ Reversal timing
│
├─ System Health
│  ├─ CPU usage per cycle
│  ├─ Memory usage
│  ├─ Database query times
│  ├─ Error rates
│  └─ Recovery success rate
│
└─ Financial Impact
   ├─ Liquidation frequency
   ├─ Gas fees from consolidation
   ├─ Portfolio value impact
   └─ Dust prevention effectiveness
```

### Step 4: Regression Testing (Ongoing)
```
1. Compare against Phase 3 integration test results
2. Verify no new regressions introduced
3. Check for performance degradation
4. Monitor for edge cases
```

### Step 5: Final Validation (Day 3)
```
1. Analyze complete 48-hour dataset
2. Generate performance baseline
3. Document any anomalies
4. Verify zero regressions
5. Create sandbox validation report
```

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Regression from Phase 3 | Low | High | Full test comparison, rollback ready |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Monitor CPU/memory, capacity planning |
| Database consistency | Low | High | Transaction validation, audit trail |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Medium | Data validation, anomaly detection |
| Extended monitoring issues | Low | Medium | Automated restart, state recovery |

### Rollback Plan
```
1. Stop monitoring
2. Revert to previous version
3. Run Phase 2 unit tests to verify
4. Document issue
5. Create hotfix ticket
```

1. **Minor Issues** (non-blocking):
   - Document in report
   - Continue monitoring
   - Flag for Phase 5 investigation

2. **Major Issues** (blocking):
   - Stop monitoring
   - Investigate root cause
   - Create hotfix
   - Return to Phase 3 testing
   - Re-run affected tests
   - Resume Phase 4

3. **Critical Issues** (system failure):
   - Immediate rollback
   - Full diagnostic analysis
   - Return to Phase 1-2
   - Redesign if needed
   - Submit for review
